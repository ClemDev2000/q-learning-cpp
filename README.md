# q-learning-cpp

A small project implementing different basic reinforcement learning techniques for a virtual cleaning robot.

## Compilation steps

This project is written in C++ and uses CMake for compilation.

Here are the steps to follow to build and run the project:

- Ensure you have [CMake](https://cmake.org/) installed on your computer.

- Create the build directory.

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
```

- Configure the project with CMake.

```sh
cmake ..
```

- Compile the project.

```sh
make
```

A file named `run.e` should appear at the root of the `build` directory.

You can now execute the program by running:

```sh
./run.e
```
